Lao: Pink pantaloons! You should be more careful... this would have never happened in my day.
Lao: You could have flown on your gentleman puffin... or coded your way across, or even just walked around!
Lao: But no, you had to fling yourself off a ledge…
Arca:
	- Thanks for saving me! My name is Arca. Who are you? -> who
	- I don't have a gentleman puffin... -> puffin

	- (if asked-who and not asked-oracle) What's an Oracle? -> oracle
	- (unless asked-imagination) Are you a figment of my imagination? -> imagination
	- So what's this code thing? -> code

Lao: I am Lao - the Oracle. I am one of the few creatures left who practices the ancient art of coding. This is my apprentice, Ada.
Ada: Hey

Lao: Oh how preposterous! I don’t know what I would do without my dearest Cecil. Such a cute little munchkin...
Cecil: Alright mate, that’s enough o’ that.
Arca:
	- Thanks for saving me. My name is Arca. Who are you? -> who
	- Uhh... Ok. I'm Arca, by the way. Are you a figment of my imagination? -> imagination

# oracle
set asked-oracle
Ada: Oracles are ancient dinosaur eggs that never hatched
Lao: Ada! That isn't true. An oracle is one who regularly skinny-dips in the sea of wisdom.

# imagination
set asked-imagination
Lao: Fascinating question my dear vegan sausage. Some say we are all figments of the Internewt's imagination. But I've met him - he really isn't that creative.

# code
Lao: Bah! Youngsters these days... Everything in the internet universe is made with code. It gives you the power to change our world and create anything you can imagine.
Lao: In ancient times, every internet creature could code - but now it has been forgotten.
Arca:
	- Could I learn to code?
		Lao: Hmm... I doubt it.
		set game.characters.arca.code-opinion = 'eager'
	- Coding sounds really difficult...
		Lao: It is easier than you think! However...
		set game.characters.arca.code-opinion = 'difficult'
	- Boring! I'd rather have a gentleman puffin
		Lao: If you think being able to create anything you want is boring... Hmph! Absolute nonsense.
		set game.characters.arca.code-opinion = 'boring'

Lao: Tremendous focus is required! You must feel the code in everything around you.
