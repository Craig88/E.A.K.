00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
Long, long ago, in dark and ancient times

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.800
we lived in a world without kitten gifs.

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.320
Then, in 345 BC (before cats), the internet arrived.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.240
All creatures rejoiced.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
They discovered something that brought great happiness and meaning to their lives.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.100
Cute, fluffy animals.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.660
They searched the web for more and more, from giant pandas to playful puppies.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.900
Suddenly, kittens grew more popular...

9
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.980
and started to appear all over the Internet Universe.

10
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.900
For a long time, you wandered the outskirts... lost and alone.

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.820
Then one day, some kittens found you.

13
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.660
The kittens named you Arca. They were the only family youâ€™d ever had.

14
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.980
Until one by one, they started going missing...
