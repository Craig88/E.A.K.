#arca-cupboard
Arca:
	- SKIP CONVERSATION -> skip
	- (unless asked-mop) Good question. I mean... she is a mop. -> hobo-mop
	- (unless asked-what) Oh no... what happened? -> hobo-what
	- (unless asked-cupboard) Don't be sad Boris... there are plenty of other mops in the cupboard -> hobo-cupboard

#arca-talk
Arca: 
  - (unless asked-forget) Um... I think you should try and forget about her. Maybe go on holiday? -> hobo-forget
  - (unless asked-hoover) Why don't you buy a hoover? Or take up yodelling? -> hobo-hoover
  - (unless asked-talk) Talk to your closest friends - it always helps when you're feeling sad. I used to talk to my kittens, but now they've gone... I really need to find them. Can you let me pass now? -> hobo-talk

#arca-where
Arca:
  - (unless asked-how) Ok... how do I do that? -> hobo-how
  - (unless asked-how) Yodelling sounds like a great idea, but I'm not sure where to start looking. -> hobo-how
  - (unless asked-hmm) Hmmm. I think you should find someone else to help you - I really need to go and save the kittens. -> hobo-hmm
