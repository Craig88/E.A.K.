hint: 'Hmmm... Looks as if we need more boxes. Try editing the level - use the <kbd>E</kbd> key or press the \'Edit\' button.'

comment: '''
  <p>These are <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags. They represent the boxes. Try to create some of your own.</p>
  <p>Remember to start with an opening <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and a closing <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>, with some writing in between. Don't forget the <code>/</code>!'''
