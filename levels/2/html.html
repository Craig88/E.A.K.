    The code below is the ledge you are on. It starts with <code>&lt;p ...&gt;</code>
    and ends with <code>&lt;<strong>/</strong>p&gt;</code>. The stuff inside is the
    text you can see. The more text, the longer the ledge. Can you change the
    writing in the middle to make the ledge long enough to reach the other side?
