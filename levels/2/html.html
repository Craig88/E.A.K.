    This <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is the ledge you are on. Can you edit the
    text inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> opening tag and the
    <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> closing tag to make the ledge long enough to reach
    the other side? Just ignore that <code>class=&quot;ledge&quot;</code> thing
    for now.

<p class="ledge">I'm a ledge! Woohoo!</p>

    This is the other platform, over there. You can edit this too!

    Uh oh! There's no way to reach this platform! Roll over to the terminal and
    press <kbd>E</kbd> (or, if you're on a mobile device, roll near it and tap
    it) to edit the source code of this level.
