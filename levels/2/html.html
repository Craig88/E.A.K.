  <p>
    This is the HTML source code to this level. It tells the browser the
    content we want to display. There's more source code elsewhere, called CSS,
    which is responsible for how everything looks, but we don't need to worry
    about that now.
  </p>

  <p>Let's look at the code below. It represents the the platform we're trying
    to get to. Each different aspect of the platform is represented by a HTML
    element. Each element has an opening tag (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) and a
    closing tag (<code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>). Everything between the two tags
    is inside the element. So, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag contains a
    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, which in turn contains the text we see shown,
    and an extra <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> tag, to format some of the text.
    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a general purpose element,
    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is a paragraph, and <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> means
    key on your keyboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can edit the code. Try changing the text below and see what happens.
  </p>
-->
<div class="platform html">
  <p>
    Uh oh! There's no way to reach this platform! Roll over to the terminal and
    press <kbd>E</kbd> (or, if you're on a mobile device, roll near it and tap
    it) to edit the source code of this level.
  </p>
</div>

<!--
  This <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is the ledge you are on. Can you edit the
  text inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> opening tag and the
  <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> closing tag to make the ledge long enough to reach
  the other side?
-->
<p class="ledge">I'm a ledge! Woohoo!</p>
