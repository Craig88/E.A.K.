<!--
  This is the source HTML source code to this level. It tells the browser the
  content we want to display. There's more source code elsewhere, called CSS,
  which is responsible for how everything looks, but we don't need to worry
  about that now. Everything inside these these <!‐‐ ‐‐> tags is called a
  comment - it's ignored by the browser, but you can use it to help understand
  your code.

<!--
  HTML elements are written with tags. Tags are like boxes: Everything between
  the <div> opening tag and the </div> closing tag is in it's own "div" box.
  Div is a pretty odd name, but it's just used for general-purpose elements.
  The class="platform html" bit is called an attribute. It's a little bit of
  extra info that goes along with our element. Here, it's used to tie in with
  CSS, but you don't need to worry about that for now. Inside the <div> element,
  there's a <p> (p stands for paragraph), which contains a load of text, with
  an inline kbd element, which tells the browser the the 'E' is refering to a
  KeyBoarD key.

  You can edit any of the code here and see the view to the right change as
  you do so. Try it now. If anything goes wrong, just use the undo button to
  fix the document.

<div class="platform html">
  <p>
    Uh oh! There's no way to reach this platform! Roll over to the terminal and
    press <kbd>E</kbd> (or, if you're on a mobile device, roll near it and tap
    it) to edit the source code of this level.
  </p>
</div>

<!--
  This <p> tag is the ledge you were on. Try editing the contents. If you
  make the ledge long enough, you may be able to reach the other side...
-->
<p class="ledge">I'm a ledge! Woohoo!</p>


<!--
  This <img> element is the kitten gif we're aiming for. Notice the src. This
  is called an attribute. In this case, the attribute tells the browser the
  location of the image.
