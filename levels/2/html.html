    This <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is the ledge you are on. Can you edit the
    text inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> opening tag and the
    <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> closing tag to make the ledge long enough to reach
    the other side? Just ignore that <code>class=&quot;ledge&quot;</code> thing
    for now.

<p class="ledge">I'm a ledge! Woohoo!</p>

    This is the other platform, over there. You can edit this too!

<p class="ledge right">Hey! I'm a ledge too!</p>
